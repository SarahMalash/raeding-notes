## article by John Sonmez:
understanding the problem domin concedered as the hardest part of programming!
john used to give his viewers the exact same simple application (protein tracker) to code so they can focus on the technology rather than the problem itself.
According to john problem domains are hard because you canâ€™t really see what you are trying to build very clearly!
**That is why you need to break down your problem into smaller pices.**
# Waterfall approach:
 is a linear approach to software development, john at a company that used this approach he saw the extreme amount of specification that was done before anything was built!
 ## so what to do to understand the problem domain?
 **1.Ma ke the problem domain easier 2. Get better at understanding the problem domain**
 # WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
 Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model, where variables are known as prooerties and sunction are called methods.
 ## creating an object:
 using literal notation: var obj = {content}
### accessing an object:
You can access properties on an object by specifying the name of the object, followed by a dot (period) followed by the property name. 
## DOM TREE:
As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory.
**It consists of four main types of nodes.**
1. THE DOCUMENT NODE: Every element, attribute, and piece of text in the HTML is represented by its own DOM node. At the top of the tree a document node is added.
2. ELEMENT NODES: to access the Dom tree you have to fid the element first then access it`s content 
3. ATTRIBUTE NODES: attribute nodes are not children of the element that carries them; they are part of that element.
4. TEXT NODES: Once you have accessed an element node, you can then reach the text within that element. This is
stored in its own text node. can not have any children.
